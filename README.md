# Speed-Monitoring-of-DC-Machines
PLC based project on control the speed of dc machines 
It uses two method two control speed; Voltage control method and Flux control method
Flux control method : In the flux control method, a rheostat (a type of variable resistor) is connected in series with the field windings. The purpose of this component is to increase the series resistance in the windings which will reduce the flux, consequently increasing the motorâ€™s speed. 
Voltage control method : In voltage control method, adding a resistance Rext in series with the armature winding leads to the voltage drop across armature increases thus voltage decreases, and due to this speed decreases as speed is directly proportional to the back emf Eb.
